# Quasar App with Vue

##### By Malbonm07

This is a personal project to demostrate my skills as a Front End developer. This a vue app created with Quasar Framework and some tools like Vue router, Html, Css and others.

### Important things to highlight:

- Use of vue router params, in this case I use it for pass a useful information like a query and get the data through axios.
- Use of single file components and reusable components.
- Creation of custom directives, mixins and custom filter.
- Use of Quasar UI components.
- LocalStorage to save data after refresh the page.
